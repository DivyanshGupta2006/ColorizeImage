# ColorizeImage
This model is still under editing phase , but basic ideas and architechtures are done.
This uses Python and PyTorch to implement a deep learning model which take grayscale images as input and gives out colored images as output
In the architechture , a series of convolutional and convolutional transpose(deconvolutional) layers are used
It is made using GAN having a discriminator and a generator
